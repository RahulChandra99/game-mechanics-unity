# Unity Commerical Game Mechanics Collection

This project includes a variety of game mechanics developed using Unity and C#. The mechanics are inspired by commercial games and cover different gameplay genres, from 2D platformers to RPGs and top-down shooters. The goal of this collection is to explore diverse gameplay systems, focusing on practical implementation and game design principles. 

All projects were developed in Unity with an emphasis on modularity, scalability, and clean code architecture to ensure reusability across different game projects.

## Mechanic 1: Anton-2D Platformer
A classic 2D platformer mechanic with jumping, wall sliding, and dashing. The focus is on smooth character movement and tight controls to deliver a satisfying gameplay experience.

## Mechanic 2: Flight Simulator Mechanics
A flight simulation system that simulates airplane physics, with controls for take-off, landing, and in-air maneuvers. This project explores flight physics, aerodynamics, and camera handling for immersive flight simulation experiences.

## Mechanic 3: Alien Shooter Top Down
A top-down shooter inspired by classic arcade shooters. Players move their character around a level, shooting enemies while avoiding obstacles. This mechanic incorporates shooting, health, and basic enemy AI.

## Mechanic 4: Hitman-GO
A turn-based strategy mechanic where players plan moves in a grid-based environment. Inspired by *Hitman Go*, the system focuses on puzzle-like gameplay where players need to strategize their way past enemies.

## Mechanic 5: Kitchen Simulator (Code Monkey)
Inspired by Code Monkeyâ€™s kitchen simulation, this project involves cooking mechanics where players manage ingredients, cook dishes, and serve customers. The game mechanics focus on resource management and time-based actions.

## Mechanic 6: Parkour-Traversal
A parkour traversal mechanic where the player can jump, vault, and climb over obstacles. This system is designed for action-adventure games, providing fluid movement and dynamic environmental interactions.

## Mechanic 7: Archery Mechanics
A realistic archery system where players draw a bow and release arrows with realistic physics. The system handles aiming, trajectory calculation, and hit detection, making it suitable for action and RPG games with ranged combat.

## Mechanic 8: Tower Defense Game with Inventory System (Unity)
A tower defense mechanic that includes an inventory system for upgrading towers and managing resources. Players build towers to defend against waves of enemies while managing their resources efficiently.

## Mechanic 9: Turn-Based Game
A classic turn-based combat system where players and enemies take turns to attack, defend, or use abilities. This project is focused on implementing turn-based logic, action points, and AI behavior in strategic combat scenarios.

## Mechanic 10: FPS Multiplayer with Friends
A multiplayer FPS mechanic that supports peer-to-peer and server-based multiplayer modes. Players can engage in real-time combat with friends, featuring shooting mechanics, respawning, and score tracking.

## Mechanic 11: Procedural Dungeon Generation
A procedural generation system that creates random dungeon layouts with enemies, loot, and traps. This mechanic focuses on algorithmic generation, ensuring high replayability for dungeon-crawling games.

## Mechanic 12: 2.5D RPG Game Mechanics
A 2.5D RPG system that combines 3D environments with 2D gameplay mechanics. The system includes RPG elements like character stats, inventory management, quests, and combat with enemies.

## Mechanic 13: DOTS and Game Mechanics
A collection of game mechanics using Unity's Data-Oriented Technology Stack (DOTS). This project explores how DOTS can be used to optimize game performance for large-scale simulations and complex gameplay mechanics.
